## DEC-001: Complete UI Rewrite Rather Than Incremental Patching (v10.0)
**Date:** 2026-02-22 | **Stage:** v10.0 sprint

### Decision
Stripped the entire v9.x button/sidebar/context-tracking UI from the codebase before building the orbital system, rather than building on top of the existing code.

### Context
The v9.x codebase (~2,369 lines) had accumulated architectural debt across multiple AI assistant development sessions. Three separate button UI systems coexisted (the Navigate button from v6.x, the context/token tracking bar from v9.0–9.3, the search button from v9.4). Button injection callbacks were wired directly into MutationObserver callbacks and the scan function, making it impossible to reason about which event triggered which UI change. The task brief (`CLAUDE-CODE-PROMPT.md`) explicitly stated "The goal is NOT to patch on top of this."

### Alternatives Considered

**Alternative: Surgical extraction** — identify the specific lines responsible for old button creation, comment them out or delete them, and build the orbital system alongside the remaining code. *Rejected because:* the entanglement between detection logic and rendering logic meant there were no clean seams to cut. MutationObserver callbacks simultaneously triggered scanning and rendering; extracting one without the other would require extensive untangling that amounted to a rewrite anyway. Surgical patches on deeply entangled code tend to leave dead branches and confusing control flow.

**Alternative: Keep context tracking** — preserve the v9.0 context/token tracking feature (fetch interception, token estimation, DOM rendering) and build orbital UI on top. *Rejected because:* the context tracking button was one of the features driving the entanglement; its own injection path conflicted with the orbital zone's injection. The task brief noted it would "eventually live inside the Navigate panel's context bar" as future work, not v10.0.

### Rationale
A clean foundation prevents future sessions from inheriting v9.x's failure modes. The Phase 1 result — 959 lines that detected platforms and found questions but rendered nothing — gave a verifiable baseline: if question detection breaks later, it's because of changes to the Phase 1 engine, not confusion about which UI code might have side effects.

### Key Properties
- Phase 1 and Phase 2 have a single defined interface: `_questions[]` array of `{ element, text, summary }` objects
- All UI code in Phase 2 reads from `_questions[]` but never modifies the detection logic
- Restoring this separation in future sprints: if question detection and UI rendering ever become coupled again, treat it as technical debt to fix

## DEC-002: Platform Abstraction Layer — Adapter Pattern for Message Access (v10.0)
**Date:** 2026-02-22 | **Stage:** v10.0 sprint

### Decision
All platform-dependent DOM access (reading messages, scrolling to messages, finding code blocks, finding links, checking streaming state) must go through a single abstraction layer:

```javascript
getPlatformAdapter(platform) → {
    getMessages()      → [{ element, text, role, index }]
    scrollToMessage(index)
    getCodeBlocks()    → [{ element, language, text }]
    getLinks()         → [{ element, href, text }]
    isStreaming()      → boolean
}
```

For platforms where selectors aren't fully verified, the adapter returns empty arrays rather than throwing — panels show "Platform not fully supported yet" rather than crashing.

### Context
The v10.0 orbital system has 6 panels: Navigate, Search, Bookmarks, Summary, Export, Settings. All but Settings depend on reading conversation messages. All 14 platforms structure their messages differently. Without abstraction, every panel would need 14 platform-specific code paths. A single platform DOM change would require updating 5 separate panels.

### Alternatives Considered

**Alternative: Direct DOM queries in each panel** — each panel calls its own `querySelectorAll` with hardcoded selectors per platform. *Rejected because:* the only reason this was tolerable in v9.x is that there was only one panel. With 6 panels, this multiplies the selector maintenance surface by 6x. A Gemini DOM update would require auditing all 6 panels.

**Alternative: Shared selector constants, no adapter** — define platform selector strings as constants, import them in each panel. *Rejected because:* this still couples panels to selector implementation; selector constants don't handle the filtering logic (e.g., ChatGPT's filter by `data-message-author-role === 'user'`). Each panel would still need platform-conditional branching.

### Rationale
Single abstraction layer means: fix the adapter for a platform → all 6 features work. Break the adapter for a platform → all 6 features degrade gracefully with a message rather than crashing. Adding a 7th feature automatically works across all platforms that have working adapters.

### Key Properties
- Feature code (Navigate, Search, etc.) must never call `document.querySelectorAll` directly for message content
- If a platform's adapter returns empty arrays, panels must display a fallback message rather than rendering an empty list with no explanation
- The adapter interface is defined in the task spec (`CLAUDE-CODE-PROMPT.md`) and should not be changed without updating it

## DEC-003: Contract-Based DOM Testing via `data-acn-*` Attributes (v10.0)
**Date:** 2026-02-22 | **Stage:** v10.0 sprint

### Decision
The userscript publishes a stable set of `data-acn-role` and `data-acn-*` attributes on key DOM elements. The test suite queries only these attributes — zero internal CSS class names, zero internal element IDs. Future UI rewrites can change every internal ID and class in the script without breaking the tests, as long as the 9 role attribute assignments are maintained.

### Context
The pre-v10.0 test suite (`tests/test-all-platforms.js`) was written against v9.x internal element IDs like `#ai-nav-button-container`, `#ai-nav-panel`, `.ai-nav-item`. These broke immediately when v10.0 introduced `#acn-zone`, `.acn-dot`, `.acn-qi`. The first v10.0 test rewrite still used internal IDs — those would break again on v11.0. The user explicitly asked for tests that "test whatever the newest version or updated version of the code we would've created. Whether it is v10 or v11 or v50."

### Alternatives Considered

**Alternative: Keep using internal IDs/classes, rewrite tests on each major version** — the simplest approach. *Rejected because:* the user explicitly identified this as the problem to solve. Internal IDs are implementation details; coupling tests to them means every UI rewrite requires a test rewrite, making the test suite a maintenance burden rather than a safety net.

**Alternative: Screenshot-based visual regression tests** — compare screenshots of the rendered UI against reference images. *Rejected because:* harder to set up in the Playwright headless environment, brittle to rendering engine differences across OS/browser combinations, and doesn't verify behavior (click, count, text content) — only appearance.

**Alternative: End-to-end tests against live sites** — navigate to real claude.ai, chatgpt.com, etc. and run assertions. *Rejected because:* requires a live network connection, is subject to site structure changes outside our control, can't be run offline or in CI without credentials/sessions, and is much slower than mock-page tests.

**Alternative: Aria roles / accessible names for test targeting** — use `role="dialog"`, `aria-label="navigate"` etc. as the test interface. *Considered favorably* but not chosen as primary approach because aria attributes carry semantic meaning that would need to be carefully designed to not mislead screen readers. The `data-acn-*` namespace is clearly test-infrastructure, not accessibility semantics, reducing the risk of misuse.

### Rationale
`data-acn-role` attributes are a stable public interface that the script author explicitly maintains. Unlike internal IDs (which might be refactored), these attributes exist specifically to be queried by tests and tooling. The author commits to maintaining them across versions; tests commit to querying only them. Either side can change its implementation details without breaking the other.

### Key Properties — Attributes the script must always maintain

| Attribute | Element | Rule |
|-----------|---------|------|
| `data-acn-role="zone"` | Main container | Must exist after injection |
| `data-acn-role="styles"` | `<style>` element | Must exist after CSS injection |
| `data-acn-role="nav-trigger"` | Navigate trigger button | Must be clickable |
| `data-acn-role="nav-panel"` | Navigate panel element | Must receive `data-acn-open="true"` when open |
| `data-acn-role="nav-stat"` | Question count display | Must have `data-acn-count="N"` attribute |
| `data-acn-role="nav-list"` | Question list container | Must exist inside nav-panel |
| `data-acn-role="nav-item"` | Each question row | Count must equal detected questions |
| `data-acn-role="nav-item-text"` | Question display text | Must be non-empty for each question |
| `data-acn-role="panel-close"` | Close buttons | Click must remove `data-acn-open` |
| `data-acn-open="true"` | Open panels | Added on open, removed on close |
| `data-acn-count="N"` | nav-stat | Numeric string, updated when questions change |
| `data-acn-accent="#hex"` | Zone element | Current theme color |
| `data-acn-version="X.Y"` | Zone element | Semantic version string |

## DEC-004: Unified Accent Color for App-Builder Platforms in v10.0
**Date:** 2026-02-22 | **Stage:** v10.0 sprint

### Decision
The 5 primary AI platforms (Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, Perplexity) each have a verified accent color in `ORB_COLORS`. The 7 app-builder platforms (Bolt, Lovable, Replit, V0, Base44, Emergent, Firebase Studio) fall back to `ORB_COLORS.claude` (`#d97706`) rather than having their own entries.

### Context
The task spec (`ORBITAL-BUTTON-SPEC.md`) notes that per-platform themes are "future work" and instructs: "For now, use Claude's orange theme everywhere. The spec mentions per-platform themes — that's a later task. Get the system working first." The 7 app-builder platforms don't have obvious brand-primary accent colors that would visually distinguish them (unlike Grok's red or Gemini's blue).

### Alternatives Considered

**Alternative: Add explicit ORB_COLORS entries for all 14 platforms immediately** — pick brand colors for Bolt (teal), Lovable (pink/purple), Replit (orange), etc. *Rejected because:* several of these platforms have undergone rebranding and their "official" primary colors are unclear without live site verification. Guessing colors that don't match the actual brand creates visual inconsistency.

**Alternative: Match the platform's own primary UI color by sampling the page** — use `getComputedStyle` on a known platform element to extract the actual brand color. *Rejected as over-engineered for v10.0:* color sampling is fragile (platform UI elements vary by theme/dark mode), adds complexity, and the spec explicitly defers this to future work.

### Rationale
Getting the orbital system working correctly for all 14 platforms takes priority over visual polish for 7 of them. Claude orange works acceptably as a neutral default — it's already the script's primary association color. Per-platform theming can be added incrementally once the system is stable.

### Key Properties
- `var orbTheme = ORB_COLORS[platform.id] || ORB_COLORS.claude;` — this fallback line is intentional
- To add a platform color: add an entry to `ORB_COLORS` with `{ bg, rgb, shadow }` matching that platform's brand
- The `rgb` field is used for CSS `rgba()` constructions in hover states and shadows; it must match the hex in `bg`

## DEC-005: CSS Transition Split — 80ms Opacity, 300ms Position (v10.0)
**Date:** 2026-02-22 | **Stage:** v10.0 sprint

### Decision
Orbital dots use two separate CSS transition durations: `opacity 80ms ease` and `transform/position 300ms cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)`. They are not combined into a single transition.

### Context
In arc and wheel modes, dots move along positional trajectories when the user scrolls. Simultaneously, their opacity changes to reflect their "focus" position. If both opacity and position animate at the same duration, brightness appears to "chase" the moving dot — it starts dim, travels to its destination, and only becomes bright at the end of the position animation. This makes the system feel laggy and dissociated.

### Alternatives Considered

**Alternative: Single transition duration for all properties** — `transition: all 300ms ease` or similar. *Tried conceptually, rejected:* opacity at 300ms means the user doesn't see the brightness change until the animation completes, making it feel like a delayed visual confirmation rather than immediate feedback.

**Alternative: 80ms for all properties** — position AND opacity animate at 80ms. *Rejected because:* position at 80ms with 6 dots moving simultaneously makes the arc/wheel transitions feel abrupt and mechanical rather than fluid.

**Alternative: No transition on opacity, instant brightness change** — 0ms opacity. *Tested mentally:* feels like flickering as the user scrolls through arc/wheel positions. The 80ms gives just enough smoothness without lag.

### Rationale
The 80ms opacity transition makes brightness feel anchored to the dot's current position (it snaps to the right brightness almost immediately) while the 300ms springy position animation gives the motion a physical quality. The split is the single most important parameter for making the orbital system feel like a tangible physical object rather than abstract buttons.

### Key Properties
- The `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)` easing for position creates a slight overshoot on arrival (spring feel). Values > 1 on Y-axis are intentional.
- If the transitions feel wrong in a future version, check both values independently — usually one has been accidentally unified or removed
- This split is documented in `ORBITAL-BUTTON-SPEC.md` under "CSS transition split" — that spec is the source of truth for timing values

## DEC-006: `scrollbarOffset` Applies Only to Closed-State Button Position
**Date:** 2026-02-22 | **Stage:** v10.0 session 2

### Decision
`platform.scrollbarOffset` is added to the `right` calculation only when the button is in the closed state (not showing the panel). When the panel is open, the button is positioned at `(window.innerWidth - _lastBoundaryX + 320)px` — the panel width, no offset.

### Context
Bolt.new has `scrollbarOffset: 16`. This was originally added in v9.6 to prevent the button from being occluded by the OS native scrollbar, which draws on the right side of Bolt's chat pane. When the isLeftChat button-panel sync fix was added (the button now tracks with the panel when open), the open-state formula accidentally included the offset, placing the button 16px further left than the panel's left edge.

### Alternatives Considered

**Alternative: Include the offset in both states.** The offset would then apply to both where the button rests (closed) and where it parks when open. *Rejected because:* the semantics are wrong. `scrollbarOffset` compensates for scrollbar width at the chat boundary. The panel's left edge has no scrollbar — applying the offset there is meaningless and creates visible misalignment.

**Alternative: Remove `scrollbarOffset` entirely and let the button sit at the exact boundary.** *Rejected because:* on Bolt with OS scrollbars enabled, the button literally overlaps the scrollbar track without the offset. The scrollbar renders on top of the button, making the rightmost part of the button unclickable.

### Rationale
The closed formula `(innerWidth - boundaryX + scrollbarOffset)` and the open formula `(innerWidth - boundaryX + 320)` serve different purposes. They look similar but are computing different things — the offset is about clearing the scrollbar at the boundary, and 320 is about aligning with the panel's known width. Keeping them separate and named makes their intent clear.

### Key Properties
- Closed: `right = (window.innerWidth - _lastBoundaryX + (platform.scrollbarOffset || 0)) + 'px'`
- Open: `right = (window.innerWidth - _lastBoundaryX + 320) + 'px'`
- 320 is the fixed panel width (see `#ai-nav-panel` CSS `width:320px`)
- Both formulas must be kept consistent across all 4 code sites that manage the button position: `legacyApplyPosition()`, `handleLegacyToggle()` open branch, `handleLegacyToggle()` close branch, and the DOM guardian callback
- If the panel width ever changes from 320px, all 4 code sites must be updated

## DEC-007: Arc Mode Labels Below Dot — CSS Attribute Selector, Not Per-Dot JS
**Date:** 2026-02-22 | **Stage:** v10.0 session 2

### Decision
Arc mode repositions hover labels from left-of-dot to below-dot using a CSS attribute selector on the zone element (`#acn-zone[data-acn-mode="arc"] .acn-lbl { ... }`). The zone element carries `data-acn-mode` set by `orbRender()` on each render. No per-dot JS is needed.

### Context
In arc mode, satellite dots are positioned in a polygon arc on the right edge of the viewport. The default label position (`right: calc(100% + 10px)` — to the left of the dot) places labels in the direction of adjacent arc dots. Labels from neighboring dots overlap each other. The fix needed to apply to all 5 satellite dots simultaneously without touching the per-dot render loop.

### Alternatives Considered

**Alternative: Set label position inline on each dot element in `orbRenderArc()`.** For each satellite dot, after setting its position, also set `dot.querySelector('.acn-lbl').style.right = 'auto'` and set `top`, `left`. *Rejected because:* this mixes layout code (label position) into the orbital layout loop (dot position). It adds 2 DOM queries per satellite per render frame, and it means label position becomes entangled with the animation frame — if `orbRender()` is called 10 times during a scroll, labels are repositioned 50 times unnecessarily.

**Alternative: Store label direction as a property per-mode, switch on `orbMode` at the top of `orbRender()`.** Enumerate the 6 dots and apply the correct label style at mode switch. *Rejected because:* this requires storing a reference to each label element (or querying them) at the top of `orbRender()`. Label position is a presentational concern that CSS is better suited to handle than JS.

**Alternative: Have mode-switch code (`orbSaveSettings()`, wheel/arc toggle handler) update a CSS class on the zone.** Add class `acn-mode-arc` when entering arc mode, remove it otherwise. CSS targets `.acn-mode-arc .acn-lbl`. *Considered favorably, not chosen:* this would also work, but `data-acn-mode` is more semantically clear (it's a data attribute describing state, not a CSS class that implies a style variant). `data-acn-mode` is also now a stable contract attribute that can be used by external tooling or future CSS rules.

### Rationale
`data-acn-mode` is set once per render frame (one `setAttribute` call), and CSS handles all label repositioning automatically. Adding a new mode in the future (e.g., `data-acn-mode="radial"`) just requires a new CSS block — no JS label-positioning code needs updating.

### Key Properties
- `zone.setAttribute('data-acn-mode', orbMode)` must remain at the top of `orbRender()`, before any dot positioning
- `data-acn-mode` values are the same as `orbMode` values: `'show-all'`, `'arc'`, `'wheel'`
- Future mode-specific CSS (not just labels) should use `#acn-zone[data-acn-mode="..."]` selectors
- The arc label CSS uses `translateX(-50%) translateY(-4px)` as hidden state and `translateX(-50%) translateY(0)` as visible state — the vertical slide mirrors the horizontal slide used in show-all mode for consistency

## DEC-008: System-UI Primary Font, Inter as Fallback
**Date:** 2026-02-22 | **Stage:** v10.0 session 2

### Decision
The full font stack for the orbital system is: `system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Inter, sans-serif`. It is set on `.acn-zone` (the orbital root element), from which all child elements inherit. The same stack is applied to both legacy panel CSS strings.

### Context
The orbital zone is a fixed-position overlay injected into the host site's `document.body`. Unlike a shadow DOM, it inherits the host site's CSS cascade. Without an explicit `font-family` on `.acn-zone`, the dots and labels would inherit from `body` or whatever the platform's root element sets — Claude used its variable serif, ChatGPT used its own sans-serif, Replit used monospace. The script needs a consistent font that works offline and doesn't depend on any CDN.

### Alternatives Considered

**Alternative: Google Fonts — Inter only, loaded via `@import`.** Hypothesis: Inter is designed specifically for UI use, has excellent cross-language coverage, and is visually consistent. *Rejected because:* requires an `@import` in the CSS string, which adds a network dependency. If the CDN is unavailable (offline use, corporate proxy, restrictive CSP), the font silently falls back to `serif` rather than gracefully to a quality sans-serif. Also, CSP on Claude and ChatGPT may block cross-origin font loads.

**Alternative: Hardcode Segoe UI as primary (Windows-native feel).** *Rejected because:* on macOS, Segoe UI is not present and the browser falls back much earlier in the stack. macOS users (a significant share of the target audience) would see a different font than Windows users, creating inconsistency.

**Alternative: `system-ui` only, no fallback.** *Rejected because:* older Firefox versions (pre-2017) and some Android WebViews don't support `system-ui`. The fallback chain ensures these environments still get a quality sans-serif (Segoe UI → Roboto → Inter → generic sans-serif).

### Rationale
`system-ui` resolves to the OS's native UI font — San Francisco on macOS/iOS, Segoe UI on Windows, and the distro default (often Ubuntu or Roboto) on Linux. This makes the script feel native on each platform without loading anything. Inter as secondary fallback covers environments where `system-ui` isn't supported and none of the other named fonts are available — it's present on ~99% of machines that have a modern browser because it ships with Figma and is widely distributed.

### Key Properties
- Set on `.acn-zone` — child elements inherit, no per-element `font-family` needed
- Also explicitly set on `.acn-panel` (which is a sibling of `.acn-zone`, not a child) and both legacy panel CSS strings
- Do NOT set individual `font-family` rules on `.acn-dot`, `.acn-lbl`, `.acn-qi`, etc. — inheritance from `.acn-zone` is sufficient and avoids duplication
- If a future version removes `.acn-zone` or restructures the DOM so panel is no longer inside zone, the panel `font-family` must be set explicitly

## DEC-009: Context Bar Uses DOM Walk to Scroll Container, Not Fetch Interception
**Date:** 2026-02-22 | **Stage:** v10.0 session 2

### Decision
The Navigate panel context bar estimates token usage by walking up the DOM from a detected user message to the conversation's scroll container, then reading `scrollContainer.innerText.length / 4`. It does not intercept `window.fetch` or read API response headers.

### Context
The v10.0 rewrite explicitly removed the v9.x fetch interception that had been used for context tracking, because it was one of the architectural entanglements that motivated the rewrite. The context bar DOM elements were built into the Navigate panel stub at v10.0 ship, but the calculation function was never implemented. This decision documents what function to use and why.

### Alternatives Considered

**Alternative: Fetch interception (intercept `window.fetch` and read response `usage` fields).** Hypothesis: Claude's API returns token usage in streaming response chunks. Intercepting these would give exact token counts rather than estimates. *Rejected because:* the v10.0 rewrite removed fetch interception intentionally (see DEC-001). Re-introducing it reintroduces the same passive global side-effect. Additionally, the usage field format differs between Claude, ChatGPT, and Grok API formats — maintaining per-platform deserialization logic for 5 platforms is ongoing maintenance burden. Claude's Artifacts and Projects interfaces also use a different streaming format from the raw API.

**Alternative: User chars × 3 multiplier.** Sum character counts for items in `_questions[]` (user messages only) and multiply by 3. Fast, zero DOM access beyond what's already been scanned. *Used as initial implementation, retained as fallback.* Problem: inaccurate for conversations where AI responses are much longer than user messages (3× underestimates) or where the user types long prompts and AI responds briefly (3× overestimates).

**Alternative: Walk up DOM from detected message to scroll container.** From `_questions[0].element`, iterate `.parentElement` until finding a node with `overflow-y: auto` or `overflow-y: scroll`. Read `innerText.length`. This container holds the entire visible conversation (user + AI), so `innerText` captures both sides. *Chosen because:* it reuses the existing DOM structure — the message detector already found `_questions[0].element`, so walking up from it is zero additional platform-specific knowledge. Works on all 5 orbital platforms because they all scroll the conversation through a single overflow container.

### Rationale
The DOM walk approach gives a full-conversation character count with no fetch interception and no platform-specific API knowledge. The `/ 4` divisor (1 token ≈ 4 English characters) is an imprecise but standard heuristic. The result is labeled "estimated" in the UI to set expectations. Platform-specific `CTX_LIMITS` values give a denominator for the percentage — these are sourced from each platform's publicly documented context window sizes.

### Key Properties
- `CTX_LIMITS` values: `claude:200000, chatgpt:128000, grok:131072, gemini:1000000, perplexity:127072`
- Default for unmapped platforms: 128,000 (chatgpt's limit, conservative)
- If a platform changes its context window size, update `CTX_LIMITS` — the platform's documentation page is the source of truth
- The DOM walk terminates at `document.body` — no infinite loop risk
- `innerText` may differ from the actual tokenized content (LaTeX, code blocks, and formatting are included in character count but may tokenize differently). This is acceptable for a visual indicator — precision isn't required
- If `_questions[0]` has no `element` property, the function falls back to the `× 3` estimate gracefully
